    <h2>Envelope strings</h2>
    <p>
      An envelope string is an encrypted representation of a secret. It is safe to store and transport,
      but useless without the correct passphrase.

    <h2>Passphrases</h2>
    <p>
      The passphrase is never stored by KeyFolio.Client. It is supplied by the user at runtime and held only in memory.

    <h2>Client vs Console</h2>
